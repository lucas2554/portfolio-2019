                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hey everyone ! My name is <strong> Lucas </strong> and I’m 20 years old. 
                    I’m currently studying <strong> web development </strong> in the city of Nancy, France. 
                    I am a soon-to-be graduated student of a <strong> Vocational Bachelor’s Degree</strong>, in Nancy’s technical college.<br>
                    I have been learning <strong>web development </strong> since my first college year. Before this I was studying in Montbéliard and I graduated with a <strong> 2-year Diploma in web development, design and marketing</strong>, so I could say that I’m really <strong> versatile in web areas</strong>. <br>
                    I’m passionate about the web, and I love to create websites from scratch, it is something I want to do in a <strong> professional </strong> way next year.
                    Apart from all of this, I’m a drummer in an orchestra so I am <strong> familiar with teamwork </strong> and I know what it is to <strong>listen to other</strong>.
